#### Transmit/Receive for 5-bit data, parity Enable, 1 STOP bit

- This is a 5-bit data transmission with a  start bit  (transitioning from 1 to 0) to indicate the beginning of data, a parity bit for error detection and one stop bit for synchronization. It ensures reliable data transfer in serial communication protocols.

#### Transmit/Receive for 6-bit data, parity Enable, 1 STOP bit

- This is a 6-bit data transmission with a  start bit  (transitioning from 1 to 0) to indicate the beginning of data, a parity bit for error detection and one stop bit for synchronization. It ensures reliable data transfer in serial communication protocols.

#### Transmit/Receive for 7-bit data, parity Enable, 1 STOP bit
